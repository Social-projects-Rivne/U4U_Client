            <p>The first settlements on the territory of the present city of Rivne appeared thousands of years ago. In particular, the remains of settlements of Cro-Magnon people, which had existed more than 15 thousand years ago, were found here.

            The first known written mention of Rivne, as one of the settlements of the Galicia-Volyn principality, dates back to 1283. But only since the 15th century Rivne began to regularly appear in historical sources.
            
            From the second half of the 14th century, Rivne was under the rule of the Lithuanian princes. In Rivne it was possible to enter from Kyiv, Ostrog and Dubno. Hence the symbol depicted on the coat of arms - the gate open for entry on three sides. In 1492, Casimir IV Jagiellon, the Polish King and the Grand Duke of Lithuania, granted the settlement the Magdeburg Law.
            
            From 1518 to 1621, the town was owned by the princes Ostrogski. In the census of 1629, it was recorded that in Rivne there were 505 houses and more than 3,000 people (in Kyiv there were about 18,000 people at the time).
            
            In the summer of 1651, the region found itself in the center of the liberation struggle of Ukrainians under the leadership of Bohdan Khmelnitsky. In 1667, as a result of the Truce of Andrusovo between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, it became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as part of the Volyn lands.</p>
